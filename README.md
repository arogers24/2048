# 2048
This is a clone of the popular mobile game, 2048.
Use your arrow keys to combine adjacent blocks of the same power-of-two value. 
Combine blocks until you reach 2048.
After each movement, a new block is generated (2 or 4) in a random free location.
If you cannot make any more moves, the game will restart and your score will be saved.
I conducted this work alongside Aidan Orr as a final project for our COSC-112 Intro to Computer Science II course.
